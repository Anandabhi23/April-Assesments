# PSET-2

This is a spin-off of [PSET-1](../PSET-1/). As a continuation fetch two strings from user such that the second string is the substring of the first.

## Example

- 'pin' is a substring of 'spin'.
- 'Heal' is a substring of 'Health'.

## Tasks

- First check whether the substring is present inside the string. (Please try this without using `in` operator).
- Write a line of code such that it returns the substring from string.
